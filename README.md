## How it started...

The first step we took was brainstorm ideas on how the webpage should look so we made some sketches to get ideas of what the page will look like.

Once we had an idea of how to structure the webpage we began talking about certain feature we wanted to have and how to acomplish them. There was alot of planning and talking in the beginning. Once the planning phase was over we began working on the code.
